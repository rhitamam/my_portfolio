## üìà Projects

### Sentiment Analysis and Stock Prediction

[Code](https://github.com/rhitamam/ada-2021-project-adaptiveness) [Website](https://rhitamam.github.io)

**Description** : This research project examines the influence of public sentiment, specifically related to the U.S.-China trade war, on stock market fluctuations. Conducted within a sophisticated data science framework, the project integrates advanced sentiment analysis tools and stock prediction methodologies to explore and identify predictive relationships between geopolitical sentiment and stock market movements. 

### Zurich Stochastic Journey Planner
[Code](https://github.com/rhitamam/stochastic-journey-planner) [Website](https://michaelroust-stochastic-journey-p-routingstreamlit-site-yvvsws.streamlit.app)

**Description** : This project is a robust public transport route planner to improve on that. The SBB dataset has been used.
Given a desired arrival time, the route planner computes the fastest route between departure and arrival stops within a provided confidence tolerance expressed as interquartiles. For instance, "what route from A to B is the fastest at least Q% of the time if I want to arrive at B before instant T".

### Finding the Higgs Boson Challenge
[Code](https://github.com/rhitamam/ml-project-1-krz) [Report](https://github.com/rhitamam/ml-project-1-krz/blob/master/project1_description.pdf)

**Description** : In the landmark Higgs boson prediction challenge, I applied advanced machine learning techniques to differentiate the elusive Higgs boson particle from background noise within simulated particle collision data from CERN's ATLAS experiment. This project aimed to enhance the signal detection accuracy, contributing to the broader field of particle physics by leveraging data-driven insights.
